hiera-eyaml-plaintext
=====================

This is a plugin encryptor for the hiera-eyaml project (hosted https://github.com/TomPoulton/hiera-eyaml/).

It encrypts using the plaintext method - which means it doesn't actually *do* anything, but is principally here to be cloned and improved. It is also useful for some tests that exist within the hiera-eyaml project.

Usage:

Really? You want to use this?

```
$ gem install hiera-eyaml-plaintext
```

Then see hiera-eyaml documentation for how to use the eyaml tool to encrypt using the 'PLAINTEXT' encryption_type.
